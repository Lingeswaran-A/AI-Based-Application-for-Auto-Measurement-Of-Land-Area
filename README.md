# AI Based Application for Auto Measurement of Land Area

🌍 Cloud Removal & Land Segmentation using CycleGAN & UNET Land Segmentation**  
🚀 A deep learning-based application for cloud removal from satellite images and land segmentation using COCO segmentation.  


## 📌 Features  
✅ Cloud Removal using a trained CycleGAN model.  
✅ Land Segmentation using a COCO segmentation model.  
✅ Flask-based Backend to handle image processing.  
✅ React/JavaScript-based Frontend for user-friendly interaction.  
✅ Git LFS Support to handle large files efficiently.  
## 🛠 Tech Stack  
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React/VanillaJS)  
- Backend: Flask (Python)  
- Machine Learning Models: PyTorch (CycleGAN), COCO segmentation  
- Database: N/A (File-based storage)  


🚀 Installation & Setup  

1. Clone the Repository
bash

git clone https://github.com/KABILESH77/-AI-Based-Application-for-Auto-Measurement-of-Land-Area



cd -AI-Based-Application-for-Auto-Measurement-of-Land-Area


🔹 2. Install Dependencies  
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install the required libraries:  
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Setup Git LFS (For Large Files)*
bash
git lfs install
git lfs pull


 4. Run the Flask Backend
bash
python app.py

The backend should now be running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

 5. Open Frontend
- Open index.html in your browser, or  
- If using React, run:
bash
npm install
npm start

## 📸 Usage  
1️⃣ Upload a satellite image (cloudy image).  
2️⃣ Click "Process" → The CycleGAN model removes clouds.  
3️⃣ The output is land-segmented using COCO segmentation.  
4️⃣ The final processed image is displayed & automatically downloaded.  

## 🎯 Results & Improvements  
✅ Cloud-Free, High-Resolution Images  
✅ Accurate Terrain Segmentation  
✅ Fast Processing with Flask API  

🔹 Future Work:  
- Improve CycleGAN model for better color correction.  
- Enhance frontend with React-based UI.
